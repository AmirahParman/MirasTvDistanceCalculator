## Site objective
This site is a calculator that helps you find your ideal TV size based on your sofa distance and vice versa. You can input either your sofa distance or your desired TV size and the calculator will show you the optimal TV size or sofa distance for your viewing comfort.
This site is useful for anyone who wants to buy a new TV or rearrange their living room furniture to get the best viewing experience possible.

## How it was made 
1. The site is made with HTML, CSS, & plain JavaScript
2. The diagram was made with diagrams.net exported in SVG and the labels are updated using JavaScript
